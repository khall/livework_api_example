This is an implementation of the API for http://api.livework.com. It uses ruby_oauth and creates a project using the API.
Pretty simple example at this point. Please see http://developer.livework.com/ for the documentation on using the API,
this app provides a sample usage of every method available. Every sample usage is in users_controller.rb, although
normally this wouldn't be the case.

Just download this via git, run the migration, start your server locally on port 3000, access http://localhost:3000/create
and the api will connect to the server and ask if you want to authorize the user bound to the oauth_token to access your
account (you may have to create an account on the machine first via the "Register" link in the upper right of the www.livework.com screen.)
This is a basic test to see if the server is correctly responding to the very basic levels of oauth. If this page doesn't
come up, then most likely other things will fail.

Authorize the user and the server will kick you back to http://localhost:3000/callback and will store a user in your
session. Now you can try creating a project.

To create a project using the API, access http://localhost:3000/create_project, this will attempt to use your oauth
request token to connect to the server and create a project. If this is successful you will be given an XML response which
will have the id of the created project.

You can update the created project by calling http://localhost:3000/update_project/<ID> where <ID> is the project id
that was returned in XML after you called the create_project.

Showing the project can be done by calling http://localhost:3000/show_project/<ID>

Creating a task can be done by calling http://localhost:3000/create_task

Updating a task can be done by calling http://localhost:3000/update_task/<ID>

Showing a task can be done by calling http://localhost:3000/show_task/<ID>

As a user who needs to work on a task, you can accept the task to work on by calling http://localhost:3000/accept_task/<ID>

If you've accepted a task and you want to begin work on it, you can call http://localhost:3000/start_task/<ID>
to mark the task as being currently worked on.

If you're done working on a task, you can mark it as completed by calling http://localhost:3000/complete_task/<ID>

If you're working on a task which is being paid by the hour, and you wish to revise the time you worked on the task
you can do so by calling http://localhost:3000/revise_work_time_task/<ID>
