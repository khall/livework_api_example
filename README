This is an implementation of the API for http://api.livework.com. It uses ruby_oauth and creates a project using the API.
Pretty simple example at this point.

Just download this via git, run the migration, start your server locally on port 3000, access http://localhost:3000/users/create
and the api will connect to the server and ask if you want to authorize the user bound to the oauth_token to access your
account (you may have to create an account on the machine first via the "Register" link in the upper right of the www.livework.com screen.)
This is a basic test to see if the server is correctly responding to the very basic levels of oauth. If this page doesn't
come up, then most likely other things will fail.

Authorize the user and the server will kick you back to http://localhost:3000/users/callback and will store a user in your
session. Now you can try creating a project.

To create a project using the API, access http://localhost:3000/users/create_project, this will attempt to use your oauth
request token to connect to the server and create a project. If this is successful you will be given an XML response which
will have the id of the created project.
